# Skills Matcher [![HitCount](http://hits.dwyl.io/fnplus/skills-matcher.svg)](http://hits.dwyl.io/fnplus/skills-matcher)

The FnPlus motto is for the whole community to learn, and to learn together. We want each and every student, developer, and programmer out there to be the best they can, and we want to help them achieve that.


## Methodology

We assess each user's previous programming background and their expertise in it. Consequently, we find the appropriate direction for them to advance into and suggest that to them.

- First proposed way to gain insight on a user experience is through their GitHub account. By analyzing their repositories and the programming languages they are comprised of, intuitions can be drawn accordingly as to which field the user would most benefit from advancing in.
- Second propsed way is to let the user manually input their interests in case that they are a beginner (and do not have a GitHub account) to find the optimal field for them.
